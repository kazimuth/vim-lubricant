Intro
-----

Vim has a lot of motions. `vim-lubricant` helps you learn them.

`vim-lubricant` watches as you type, and if it sees a way your editing could be
faster, it lets you know.

Installation
------------

This plugin is in the normal vim plugin format, and so can be installed with
whatever package manager you want. If you don't have a package manager, try
[`vim-plug`][1].

-  [Plug][1]
  -  `Plug 'kazimuth/vim-lubricant'`
-  [Vundle][2]
